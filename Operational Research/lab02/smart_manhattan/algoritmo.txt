1. Using the trfm T find s and d such that t_sd = max t_ij for all ij. Set t_sd = -1.
2. If both s and d do not appear in S go to 3
	If either s or d appear in S go to 4
	If both are present go to 5
3. If there is a pair of adjacent locations in L (i.e. a possible lightpath between s and d) locate s and d in those positions, then:
	- add s and d to S
	- remove from L the locations corresponding to s and d
4. Suppose s was placed. Then, if a free position adjacent to S exists in L:
	- place d in this position, add d to S
	- remove from L the location corresponding to d
5. If there are still free positions in L, go to 1 otherwise stop. 

T = traffic matrix
S = set of nodes placed
L = all positions in topology => matrix bij, manhattan topology

1. trova tsd
2. 3 check da fare:
	- s e d non sono presenti in S
	- s O d Ã¨ presente in S
	- s e d sono presenti in S
3. adjacent locations in manhattan sono
		#+#
		+S+ se nel centro della matrice 
		#+#
		
Devo comunque ordinare gli archi
